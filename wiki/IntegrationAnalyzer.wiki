=== Change Look & Feel ===
It is possible to change chart settings the same way as if you were using it on CDF, for more information about available settings check [SupportedParameters].How to:
  # Open file _\fusion_plugin\js\vizapi\chart_settings.js_
  # Edit the returned properties on 2 levels:
    # Overall, applies to every chart and are set by changing the function _getOverallSettings()_
    # For each chart type you can create a specific function that contains specific properties and can override overall settings. The function name must be the same as the chart id (id can be found on _\fusion_plugin\js\vizapi\fusioncharts_wrapper.js_). The plugin ships with an example _fcplugin_angulargauge()_
