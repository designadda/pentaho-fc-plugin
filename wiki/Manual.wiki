= Usage =

== Standalone Chart ==

When defining a standalone chart you must create a .xFusion file where the parameters can be configured. You can find some examples in the following path _bi-developers/fusion-samples/Fusion Charts Free_. For more information check [StandAloneCharts].

|| If the licensed version is being used don't forget to set the _free_ parameter to "false". ||

== Building CDF Dashboards ==

The plugin can easily be used on a CDF dashboard. To allow a seamless integration with, the plugin ships with a new CDF component called FusionChartComponent. This component works the exact same way as the existing chart components. The component can be found on the samples directory: _fusion-samples/Dashboards/FCPluginCDFComponent.js_. A sample dashboard can be found at the samples directory _bi-developers/fusion-samples/Dashboards_. For more information go to [CDFComponent FusionChartComponent here].


== Enterprise Dashboards ==

You can simply drag and drop your xfusion file into the dashboard designer and create simple and effective dashboards. To test this feature you can simply go through the following steps:

Create a new dashboard in the PUC.
Navigate to the bi-developers/fusion-samples/Fusion Charts Free directory in the solution explorer.
Drag and drop the chart samples into the dashboard.

== Pentaho Analysis Visualizations ==
The plugin can be used to extend visualization types on Analyzer. For more information check this [IntegrationAnalyzer page]


= Additional Information =
== Free Vs. Licensed Version  ==
In the Free version the flash object use the `<embed>` tag and the element is  displayed above all other elements. In the Licensed Version the flash object use the `<object>` tag and you can define the displayed order

== XActions (Not Available)==

The FusionCharts plugin is not available on Xactions. The chart library relies on Flash\html5 technologies requiring a browser for rendering.
