== CDF Extensions ==

The integration with CDF was made by creating a CDF component called [CDFComponent FusionComponent] that permits the definition of the charts in the client side and communicates with the server side getting the chart. This component can be found in the samples directory (fusion-samples/Dashboards) in the FCPluginCDFComponent.js file.

= Usage =

== Render on PUC ==

To test the samples in the Pentaho User Console all you need to do is extract the samples zip file into the bi-developers solution, refresh the solution repository and run the samples.

== Build Dashboards ==

To build a dashboard you'll need a HTML structure and the FusionComponent to define the charts that will be used in the dashboard. A dashboard example can be found in the samples directory (fusion-samples/Dashboards).

== Xactions ==

The Fusion Charts plugin is not available to use on Xactions. The chart library relies on the Flash technology and requires a browser to render the objects.
