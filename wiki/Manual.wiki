This component works the exact same way as the existing chart components. The component can be found on the samples directory: _fusion-samples/Dashboards/FCPluginCDFComponent.js_. A sample dashboard can be found at the samples directory _bi-developers/fusion-samples/Dashboards_. For more information go to [CDFComponent FusionChartComponent here].
